# Plan
## Monday 16/12
* Make plan (this->instance = this;)
* Implement go towards middle experiment
* Write velocity experiment
* Write about state-space and action-space
* Make sure observation stacking agent works

## Tuesday 17/12
* Train and evaluate observation stacking agent
* Write the experiment section for middle and middle forward experiment (no result and conclusion)
* Research batch normalization and implement if needed
* Write background and problem statement
* Write related works

## Wednesday 18/12
* Train and evaluate go to middle agent and go to middle + forward agent
* Write result and conclusion for middle and middle forward experiment
* Plan out report exactly and figure out exactly what is there and what is missing
* Overall report writing

### Report things to be done
* More introduction, short about DQN and other things we use.
* Problem statement
* Section 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 needs a look at (old)
* Read Background and method and look for overlap
* Experiements needs finishing and touchup - see todos in code
* The last 3 sections and references missing
* Graphs for reward and loss for the experiments
* In method section: Reward function and What? Why? How? about reward
* In method section: Network architecture, why, tie in with Experiments
* Intro to experiments.

## Thursday 19/12
* Code freeze, only report
* Finish report, only minor issues left

## Friday 20/12
* Final report stuff.
* If time write github readme detailing how to download and run game
* 14:00 - Hand-in
